    "## Introduction\n",
    "Heat maps are another way of plotting spike train data. An example is below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/heat_map.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Like a PSTH, the heat map has time on the *x* axis, and plots the probability of spikes at each time point. But we're able to show all intensity levels in a single plot, by putting intensity on the *y* axis and using colour, rather than bar height, to represent the number of spikes. Heat maps are a more condensed, information-rich, and efficient version of the PSTHs: rather than needing 10 plots to show the histograms for all 10 levels of intensity, we do so in a single plot. Heat maps allow us to plot *three dimensions* rather than only two; we have the *x* and *y* axes, and then we can plot a third variable (dimension) using colour (or intensity of colour). Think of it as if the above plot rotated in a plane, so that if before, you were looking at the plot from the side, now you're looking at it from above. More intense colours indicate a higher spike probability at that time point. "

Let's run this function just for one intensity level (9) so that we can see what the histogram looks like as a NumPy array:\n",

The 2D array we'll create is shaped exactly like the one above: with time as columns, and intensity levels as rows. Since we know in advance the dimensions of this array (10 rows and 21 columns), we can make a NumPy array of that shape (with a function called `np.zeros()`, which fills all cells with zero to start) and then fill each row as we go through the loop of intensities. Note that we're only saving the histogram part of the `np.histogram()` function, not the bins, since the bins are the same for every histogram. \n",

    "\n",
    "For better or for worse, a consequence of the bilinear interpolation is that it takes data that were measured at discrete levels of stimulus intensity, and interpolates between those levels to provide a smoothed representation of the data. In other words, it's making inferences about what the values would be in between the tested levels of stimulus intensity. In contrast, in the original *nearest neighbour* heat map we created, each square in the plot represented the number of spikes in one bin in a PSTH. So the nearest neighbour approach is a more literal representation of the data, but the bilinear interpolation makes inferences about the data points we didn't measure (and also just looks nicer to most people).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is not to imply that interpolation is invalid; indeed it's a valuable tool and interpolation methods are mathematical formulae that are reproducible and well-understood. In this heat map, the dimensions on both the *x* and *y* axes (time and light intensity) are [**continuous**](../visualization/plotting_types) values that we have [**discretized**](../visualization/plotting_types) into a set of levels for the purposes of measuring spikes in this experiment. So interpolating between the measured values makes sense, because then we are representing these variables in a more continuous fashion than just the levels that we have data for. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, it's important to be aware of interpolation and consider what effects it might have in some situations. On the positive side, interpolation can reduce noise in the data by smoothing it. On the other hand, if there are big gaps in your data it may not be appropriate to interpolate, because interpolation makes certain assumptions about the shape (distribution) of your data - and the differences between interpolation methods amount to the differences in assumptions that are made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are examples showing different interpolation methods. Bicubic is the smoothest-looking, where nearest-neighbor looks \"blocky\" because it's plotting the actual values with no interpolation, more consistent with the actual data. The Hanning method produces results that appear somewhat in between the others. \n",

    "### Colour Map Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "One final comment about the heat maps above: your choice of colour map (`cmap`) matters. One way to choose a colour map is based on one's individual intuitions about aesthetics. For example, I personally think the one used above (`hot`) is quite attractive. However, it's important to consider the neuroscience of how humans interpret colour. Even though the colour spectrum is continuous (wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation ranging from approximately 400–700 nm), we see it as distinct colours (classically, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet). Although we can discriminate different hues within each of those colours, we nonetheless see colours categorically. In other words, two equally-different values at different parts of the colour range may not be perceived as the same magnitude of difference. For example in the bottom left (`cmap='jet'`) the green areas seem to 'pop' relative to the blue, and there is are patches of orange that really stand out. \n",

An excellent choice is one of the [Viridis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/viridis/vignettes/intro-to-viridis.html) family of colourmaps, which were explicitly designed to have these properties, and also be aesthetically appealing.
